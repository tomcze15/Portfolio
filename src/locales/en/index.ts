    P1: "My name is Tomasz Czerwi≈Ñski I'm 24 years old and I come from Szczecin. Professionally I programme, and currently I'm a frontend developer. I would like to present my short story how it came about",
    P2: 'My adventure with programming began mundanely from computer games, but I was looking for something more than just unproductive entertainment, so for a long time I was interested in the way my games were created. Over time, the range of my interests expanded and I began to take an interest in the world of webdevelopment. This determined my choice of schools and so I graduated from SCI with a degree in Computer Science and completed studies in Computer Science at the Naval Academy with a degree in Engineering. This all contributed to my fascination with creating new software, desktop and web applications, and of course games. Already during the graduation I was accepted for an internship at a global company where a short while after the internship, along with my skills, I found myself in a professional project, where the main goal was to design a panel for electric cars from one of the major manufacturers in America.',
    P3: 'I am highly motivated to work in a professional team where I will not only give my best, but am also able to learn a lot. By hiring me, your company will gain many benefits from my enthusiasm to work and develop my skills.',
